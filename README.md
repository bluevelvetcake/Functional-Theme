# Functional-Theme

A function over form theme that isnt ugly. Based on the old amCoder theme.

Install it by downloading and unzipping into your `Packages` directory, find it by running `Preferences: Browse Packages` in sublime.
Remember to rename the folder to `Theme - Functional`

I'm not going to try to get it onto package control until i can reasonably call it finished.
